# Statement

The purpose of this project is to help researchers easily access patent indicators. This is done through a number of functions 
that calculate and fetch certain patent for a given set of publication numbers. The project uses Google Patents Public Data hosted 
on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by querying and wrangling data sourced from its tables. The user will need to connect to their GCP account 
and can easily do so through the provided functions, as explained below.
