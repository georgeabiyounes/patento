# Statement

The purpose of this project is to make building patent indicators more accessible to researchers. The project provides the user with more than 30 patent indicators that can be fetched using the different functions. Patento uses Google Patents Public Data hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by querying and wrangling data sourced from its tables using BigQuery. This package is part of an academic project under the name "Replicable Patent Indicators".
